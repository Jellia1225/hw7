    "rubric={points}\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing is a crucial step before carrying out topic modeling and it markedly affects topic modeling results. In this exercise, you'll prepare the data using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) for topic modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Write code using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to preprocess the `text` column in the given dataframe `df` and save the processed text in a new column called `text_pp` within the same dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have spaCy in your course environment, you'll have to [install it](https://spacy.io/usage) and download the pretrained model en_core_web_md. \n",
    "\n",
    "`python -m spacy download en_core_web_md`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no such thing as \"perfect\" preprocessing. You'll have to make your own judgments and decisions on which tokens are likely to be more informative for the given task. Some common text preprocessing steps for topic modeling include: \n",
    "- getting rid of slashes, new-line characters, or any other non-informative characters\n",
    "- sentence segmentation and tokenization      \n",
    "- replacing urls, email addresses, or numbers with generic tokens such as \"URL\",  \"EMAIL\", \"NUM\". \n",
    "- getting rid of other fairly unique tokens which are not going to help us in topic modeling  \n",
    "- excluding stopwords and punctuation \n",
    "- lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Check out [these available attributes](https://spacy.io/api/token#attributes) for `token` in spaCy which might help you with preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You can also get rid of words with specific POS tags. [Here](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/) is the list of part-of-speech tags used in spaCy. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You may have to use regex to clean text before passing it to spaCy. Also, you might have to go back and forth between preprocessing in this exercise and and topic modeling in Exercise 2 before finalizing preprocessing steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that preprocessing the corpus might take some time. So here are a couple of suggestions: 1) During the debugging phase, work on a smaller subset of the data. 2) Once you finalize the preprocessing part, you might want to save the preprocessed data in a CSV and work with this CSV so that you don't run the preprocessing part every time you run the notebook. \n",

Then I performed sentence segmentation and word tokenization. Also I replaced URLs, email addresses, and numerical values with the tokens \"URL\", \"EMAIL\", and \"NUM\" respectively. After that, I filtered out other rare tokens that are unlikely to contribute meaningfully to topic modeling. Then, I removed common stopwords and punctuation, as they are frequent across all text and do not typically aid in identifying distinct topics. At last, I applied lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms."

    "1. Content-based filtering recommends items to users based on the features of items they have previously liked or interacted with. It builds a profile of the user using item attributes (e.g., genre, keywords, tags) and suggests new items with similar features. For example, if a user watches many romance movies, the system recommends other movies labeled as romance or with similar plots or actors.\n",
    "2. One bad thing might happen is Privacy Concerns: To provide personalized recommendations, systems often collect and analyze large amounts of personal data, raising ethical and privacy issues if not handled responsibly. On the other, lack of new things and diversity: Recommender systems tend to reinforce a user’s existing preferences, limiting exposure to diverse or new content, which may lead to narrow worldviews or polarizing effects.\n",

The model, already trained on large text corpora, has learned general language representations and can be fine-tuned on a specific small task. This boosts performance and reduces training time.\n",
